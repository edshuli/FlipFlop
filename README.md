## UX

My goal in the design of the website is to prvide an easy access to all the important information on the site while allowing
the users to become familiar with it by maintaining the consistency. I choosed a orange-beige and grey color scheme to create a warm
and modern felling while I kept on the background an image that makes people relaxed and really get in a 
flipflop state of mind.

The main goal of this website is to provide all neseccary information that a traveler needs in order the make 
the correct decision. So here we provide suggestions about the Top 10 Destinations and we inspire them through
our column Travel Inspiration, where they can explore places according to the type of travel, either 
Family Holidays, Travel on Budget and many more other types. 

Users also have access to various resources via the Google Maps:

**1.Hotels**
**2.Attractions**
**3.Restaurants**
**4.Cafe & Bars**

All travelers want to know if they have a coffee place for their morning coffee or a drink 
before their night out.

My aim here was to make travelers feel like they are locals. 

**5.Shopping**

The websites has information about popular destinations chosen by many sites such as Lonely Planet, 
Trip Advisor and many more. 
There is a Google Maps Se




## Technologies

*The technologies we used to create the website are the follow:*

1.HTML</br>
2.CSS </br>
3.Bootstrap v4.3</br>
4.JavaScript</br>
5.Jquery</br>
6.Google Maps

## Features

The navigation-bar stays fixed at the top, it has a transparent background-color with grey-color menu items. But on width max-767
the navbar stays collapsed and fixed on the top to provide an easy access to menu items.
</d>
We have the Top Destinations container which have 4 cards with images attached and titles, each one of them 
directs you to another webpage where I provide more information about each specific card.
</d>

Travel Inspiration container is a carousel with images and a specific type of travel, each on of them
directs you to another website from another host! Here I want to thank @LonelyPlanet.


Contact container contains the contact form, where people can send me a message by filling this form. In case of an invalid put
the use will be notified with a warning, and if every field is filled correctly the page will be reloaded. 

Footer contains contact information where people can reach us even throu email,phone number or pass by. 
It also contains two social links the one is LinkedIn and this directs to my personal profile as I am
the creator of the website and the other one directs to my Instagram profil where the user can have a closer at some 
pics from the countries I have been.

## Features Left to Implement
**In the future I would like to implement the following features**

1.I will link the showMap button on the cards in the Top Destinations Container, and that button will direct them
immediately to the Google Maps and there they can also search about hotels, restaurants, tourist attractions

2.I want to custom the Google Maps map and the infoWindow with more details

3.I will access a booking system for hotels

4.And I will add package travels where people can choose accordingly to their preferences.

In the future I would like to change the progress-bars, add some animation hover or even change the whole style maybe make it a circle.
I also would like to add more projects on my portfolio and make somme changes on the navbar.

## Testing

I used mainly <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/" target="_blank">DEVTOOLS</a>for my testing.

The screen sizes tested on decision are the below:

1.Galaxy S5</br>
2.Pixel 2</br>
3.Pixel 2XL</br>
4.iPhone 5/SE, iPhone 6/7/8, iPhone 6/7 Plus, iPhone X</br>
5.iPad</br>
6.iPad Pro</br>
7.Desktop

The site was tested on many browsers (Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Mozila Firefox) and mobile devices such as Iphone8,6s, Huaweii P20 Lite,
Samsung Galaxy S10, Samsung Galaxy A20 (Chrome, Ipad, Safari) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. </br>
During this testing I faced a problem with the carousel container on mobile devices was not loading correctly and the text was not shown so
I changed the margin of the text and the width and height of the carousel itself so now is loading correctly. 
</br>

**I used the below validators throught the website**

1.<a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">W3C-Validator Service</a></br>
2.<a href="https://jshint.com/" target="_blank">JavaScript-Validator Service</a>

 

#### Navbar Menu

If you click on any of the sections, you will be directed to your prefered one, the back action is tested and it workes properly.

#### Jumbotron

I didn't face any problems with the jumbotron, only had to make some changes on the screen display.

#### Contact 

If you try to submit the contact form with an invalid email address,then an error will be appeared notified the invalid address.
Also teh  required attribute is added to the  'name', 'phone' and 'message' fileds so if those fields are not filled in then the user will be
asked to fill in this fields and the form will not be submitted. If all fields are valid then the page will be reloaded.</br>

#### Links

Using the 'target="_blank"' all links will open in a new tab and the CV will be dowloaded to your default folder for download
and this is done because of the 'download' attribute.
All links have been manually tested to make sure that they are pointing to the correct destination.
